- GitHub:

    - Used to submit code for assignments and upload layouts/storyboards, and logos for the group project.
    - Pros: It was easy to host work needed to submit for class and  see what everyone was working on in the group project.
    - Cons: First time using GitHub, had to get used to the layout of new commits and creating a new directory to host items needed for the group project.

- Slack:

    - Used to stay in (immediate) communication with everyone in my specific team and the group project as a whole 
    - Pros: Easy to use and update everyone working on the group project about new work/contributions, get any new modifications to page layouts and logos to others quickly and efficiently. Easy to get notifications when anyone else had any new contributions or questions.
    - Cons: Not everyone involved in the group project used or frequently checked the app so there would be a delay in responses between teams.

- Adobe Illustrator:

    - Used to draw up/design web page layouts/storyboards and logos
    - Pros: Easy to use, draw up new concepts, and save high resolution files. Ability to use on the go.
    - Cons: Not many, I am quite used to this application. Inability to save .PNG and .SVG files, only .JPEG.

- Gmail:
    - Used to keep in contact (less immediate and more detailed) with everyone
    - Pros: Easy to use and receive information important to the project
    - Cons: Less immediate in responses, sometimes easy to get lost amongst many other email messages
