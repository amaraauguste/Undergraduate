Augmented reality could solve alot of our real world problems without using energy in our physical world and to create optimal solutions.","The presenter explained what augmented reality is and gave real world uses and how we sometimes used AR like in snapchat filters, the presenter also showed us videos to demonstrate some more sophisticated uses of augmented reality like with modeling.","The presenter was hard to hear and there was a lot of information displayed on the slides where it was hard to read everything because of the pace of the presentation.
